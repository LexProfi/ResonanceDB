### 2.3 Technical-context notice (ML/training, automated ingestion, third-party AI systems)

Certain technical usage contexts can create ambiguity in how the Prosperity Public License 3.0.0 is evaluated in practice, including without limitation:

* **machine learning training** (including fine-tuning, pretraining, alignment, evaluation, distillation, or dataset creation intended for any of the foregoing),
* **model optimization** and benchmarking,

**No license modification.** `TRAINING_NOTICE.md` is an interpretive and compliance notice only. It does **not** create new license terms, does **not** add conditions beyond the Prosperity Public License 3.0.0, and does **not** grant any rights not expressly granted by the Prosperity Public License 3.0.0.

### 2.4 Resolution of inconsistencies
