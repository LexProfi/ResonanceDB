# TRAINING NOTICE — Machine Learning and Model Training Use

Effective date: 2026-01-08 (first publication in this repository)  
Applies to: ResonanceDB source code, documentation, specifications, and related materials

## 1. Purpose of This Notice

This notice is provided **for avoidance of doubt** and explains the
Contributor’s interpretation of how the term **"commercial use"** under the
**Prosperity Public License 3.0** applies to **machine learning, artificial
intelligence, and model training activities**.

This notice does **not** replace, amend, or modify the LICENSE file.
In the event of conflict, the LICENSE file controls.

## 2. Definition of Training as Use

For purposes of this project, using ResonanceDB materials for **training,
fine-tuning, pretraining, alignment, evaluation, distillation, or dataset
creation intended for any of the foregoing** constitutes **use** of the
software and associated materials.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- ingestion into training datasets or corpora,
- feature extraction or embedding generation,
- gradient-based or statistical learning,
- supervised, unsupervised, or self-supervised learning,
- reinforcement learning with human or synthetic feedback,
- dataset curation derived from the source code or documentation,
- automated analysis intended to improve or inform a model deployed,
  offered, or intended for deployment.

---

## 3. Commercial Training Use

Training or using ResonanceDB materials **in connection with**:

- a commercial entity,
- a for-profit organization,
- a commercial research lab,
- a product, service, or platform offered commercially,
- internal tooling supporting commercial products,
- foundation models or APIs offered for a fee or monetized directly or indirectly,

is treated as **commercial use** for purposes of the Prosperity Public License 3.0,
regardless of whether:

- the trained model reproduces the source code verbatim,
- the trained model exposes similar APIs,
- the implementation differs technically,
- the training data is mixed with other sources,
- the resulting model weights are non-reversible or non-extractable.

Commercial use beyond the 30-day evaluation period requires a paid commercial
license. Contact: **license@evacortex.ai**.

## 4. Non-Commercial Training Exceptions

The following uses are generally treated as **non-commercial**, consistent with
the **Personal Uses** and **Noncommercial Organizations** sections of the
Prosperity Public License 3.0:

- purely personal, non-commercial research with no anticipated commercial application,
- academic research conducted by non-commercial institutions,
- government or public research organizations,
- charitable or educational use,
- model training performed solely for open scientific publication with no
  commercial deployment or monetization.

## 5. Relationship to Patent Rights

ResonanceDB is subject to one or more pending patent applications.

**No patent license is granted at this time.**

Use of ResonanceDB materials to develop or train machine learning systems that
implement, approximate, reproduce, or are derived from techniques described in
the codebase or documentation may implicate patent rights, even if the resulting
implementation differs.

Any patent license, if and when granted, will apply only while the user remains
in full compliance with the Prosperity Public License 3.0 and any applicable
commercial licensing terms.

## 6. Notice to Dataset and Model Distributors

If you redistribute, mirror, or include ResonanceDB materials in datasets,
corpora, archives (including model-training datasets), or similar collections,
you should include:

- the LICENSE file, and
- this TRAINING-NOTICE.

This notice applies to all uses occurring on or after the effective date,
including retraining, fine-tuning, evaluation, and derivative dataset creation,
regardless of when the materials were originally obtained.
