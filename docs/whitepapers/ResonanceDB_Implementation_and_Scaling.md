### *Architectural Design, Storage Format, and Horizontal Expansion*

---

## ⚙️ 1. Overview

ResonanceDB is a waveform-based cognitive storage system designed to hold and retrieve semantic patterns using **constructive interference**. This document details the **low-level architecture**, **binary storage format**, **access contracts**, and **scalability mechanisms**.

Where the first whitepaper introduced the ontological and theoretical foundation, this part focuses on concrete implementation decisions and their justification.

---

## 🧩 2. Core Data Structure: WavePattern

```java
public record WavePattern(double[] amplitude, double[] phase) {
  public Complex[] toComplex() { ... }
}
```

* `amplitude[]`: real-valued intensity of meaning.
* `phase[]`: real-valued modifiers for context, modality.
* Arrays are fixed-length (configurable, e.g., 512, 1024).

> All operations on WavePattern are side-effect free and deterministic.

---

## 📦 3. Storage Format and Layout

### 3.1 File Structure

ResonanceDB uses a segmented file layout to store wave patterns in binary form. Each segment file corresponds to a **phase-local shard**, allowing parallel reads and dynamic expansion.

```
/resonance-db/
├── segments/
│   ├── phase-0.segment        # memory-mapped binary segment (initial)
│   ├── phase-1.segment        # auto-added when phase-0 is full
│   ├── phase-2.segment        # ...
├── index/
│   └── manifest.idx           # central mapping: ID → segment, offset
├── metadata/
│   └── pattern-meta.json      # JSON: id → metadata
```

#### Segment Naming

Each segment is named by its insertion order within a phase group:

```
phase-0.segment, phase-1.segment, phase-2.segment, ...
```

New segments are automatically created when the current one reaches capacity. This allows horizontal scaling without interrupting inserts.

#### Memory Mapping

All `.segment` files are mapped into memory using `MappedByteBuffer` in read-only or read-write mode, depending on their role.

---

### 3.2 Segment Encoding

Each `.segment` file stores a flat binary serialization of `WavePattern` entries. All values are encoded in **little-endian** format.

#### Segment Entry Layout

Each pattern entry is aligned to 8 bytes and has the following structure:

```
[offset]
├── id hash       : 16 bytes  // MD5 content hash (binary)
├── length        : 4 bytes   // number of elements in amplitude[] / phase[]
├── reserved/meta : 4 bytes   // reserved for future use (e.g., versioning)
├── data block:
│   ├── amplitude[] : double[length]
│   └── phase[]     : double[length]
[alignment padding if needed]
```

* The **total entry size** is `HEADER_SIZE + encodedWaveSize`, where:

  * `HEADER_SIZE = 24 bytes`
  * `encodedWaveSize = estimated size of amplitude + phase arrays`
* Padding is added to ensure 8-byte alignment for safe mmap traversal.

#### Segment Header (not part of individual entries)

Each segment starts with a **binary header** (`BinaryHeader`) containing:

* magic bytes,
* segment metadata,
* last valid offset (used for scan boundary detection).

#### Special Markers

* Entries starting with `0x00` are **tombstones** (logically deleted patterns).
* Tombstones retain their full structure for alignment and offset validity, but are skipped during reads.

#### Validation

Deserialization must verify:

* Correct ID and length fields.
* Sufficient remaining bytes for full entry.
* Alignment consistency and buffer bounds.

#### Example Layout (simplified)

```
[BinaryHeader]
  ├── magic, version, lastOffset
[PatternEntry_1]
  ├── id[16] + len[4] + meta[4] + data[ampl+phase]
[PatternEntry_2]
  ...
[Tombstone]     // 0x00 + id[15] + len[4] + meta[4] + padding
```

> Note: No inline compression is applied. All floats are stored as 64-bit IEEE 754 doubles. Entries are read via `MappedByteBuffer` without copying the entire file into memory.


---

## 🗺️ 4. Indexing and Manifest

The `manifest.idx` maintains:

* pattern ID (string hash)
* segment filename
* byte offset in segment
* phase range metadata

This index allows:

* O(1) or O(log n) retrieval of patterns
* filtering by phase domain (shard selection)

---

## 🚀 5. API Contract: ResonanceStore

```java
public interface ResonanceStore {
  String insert(WavePattern psi, Map<String, String> metadata);
  void delete(String id);
  String replace(String id, WavePattern psi, Map<String, String> metadata);
  List<ResonanceMatch> query(WavePattern query, int topK);
  float compare(WavePattern a, WavePattern b);
  List<ResonanceMatchDetailed> queryDetailed(WavePattern query, int topK);
  InterferenceMap queryInterference(WavePattern query, int topK);
  List<InterferenceEntry> queryInterferenceMap(WavePattern query, int topK);
  List<ResonanceMatch> queryComposite(List<WavePattern> patterns, List<Double> weights, int topK);
  List<ResonanceMatchDetailed> queryCompositeDetailed(List<WavePattern> patterns, List<Double> weights, int topK);
}
```

### Requirements:

* All methods are thread-safe.
* `compare()` is deterministic and stateless.

---

## 🧲 6. Comparison Kernel

### 6.1 Resonance Equation

Each wave pattern is interpreted as:

$$
\psi(x) = A(x) \cdot e^{i\varphi(x)}
$$

Similarity is computed as normalized interference energy:

$$
R(\psi_1, \psi_2) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{|\psi_1 + \psi_2|^2}{|\psi_1|^2 + |\psi_2|^2} \cdot \left( \frac{2 \cdot \sqrt{E_1 E_2}}{E_1 + E_2} \right)
$$

Where:

* $|\psi|^2$ — total energy  
* $E_1$, $E_2$ — input energies
* result is normalized in \[0.0 .. 1.0].

Additional diagnostics include:

* `compareWithPhaseDelta()` — returns energy + signed phase delta $\Delta\varphi \in [-\pi, +\pi]$

---

## 🌐 7. Horizontal Scaling

### 7.1 Sharding Model

Sharding is done by **phase domain**, not ID hash. Each `.segment`:

* owns a phase range (e.g., \[0.0 .. π/2]),
* can be assigned to an agent/machine.

Segment-aware query routing allows:

* distributed query agents,
* parallel scanning,
* load balancing.

### 7.2 Segment Routing

Each query pattern is routed to a subset of segments based on its **phase topology**, specifically the **mean phase** across all dimensions:

```text
query ψ has phase avg ≈ π/3 → routed to phase segment group covering [π/4 .. π/2]
```

#### Phase-Based Segment Groups

Segments are organized into **PhaseSegmentGroups**, each responsible for a particular range of phase values (e.g., `[0 .. π/2]`, `[π/2 .. π]`, etc.).

Within each group:

* Multiple segments may exist: `phase-0.segment`, `phase-1.segment`, etc.
* Inserts go to the first available non-full segment (`getWritable()`).
* Reads are performed across all relevant segments in parallel.

#### Routing Example

Suppose the query has:

```
ψ.phase().average() = 1.05 ≈ π/3
```

Routing proceeds as follows:

1. Phase selector maps this to the group handling `[π/4 .. π/2]`.
2. All segments in that group are queried:

   ```
   segments/phase-2.segment
   segments/phase-3.segment
   ...
   ```
3. Results are merged and ranked globally.

#### Benefits

* Enables **scalable insert capacity** without hash-based sharding.
* Supports **local reasoning** within phase-coherent regions.
* Allows dynamic expansion: new segments are added on demand.

> This model supports distributed agents, field-local reasoning, and phase-differentiated cognitive indexing.

## 🧵 8. Concurrency and Thread Safety

* All segment writes are atomic.
* Read operations use `MappedByteBuffer` (read-only mode).
* Metadata and manifest files are updated via locks or CAS.
* Caches use `ConcurrentMap` or Caffeine.

---

## 🗰️ 9. Error Handling

| Error Condition               | Exception                     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Duplicate insert with same ID | `DuplicatePatternException`   |
| Update/delete of unknown ID   | `PatternNotFoundException`    |
| Invalid wave dimensions       | `InvalidWavePatternException` |

---

## 🔧 10. Extensibility Points

* Pluggable kernel for `compare()`
* Tag filters, time-based filters
* `ResonanceTrace`: store query dynamics
* Future: support for vector-field overlays

---

## 🧪 11. Testing Strategy

* Unit tests for insert/update/query/delete
* Interference normalization tests
* Stress test: 1M patterns, mmap performance
* Query determinism tests (repeatability)

---

## 🗂️ 12. Dependencies & Licensing

* Language: **Java 22+**
* Binary format: **custom codec** or FlatBuffers
* I/O: `MappedByteBuffer`, `FileChannel`
* Optional: Index caching (pluggable; not yet integrated)
* License: Apache 2.0 compatible only

---

## ✅ 13. Summary

This architecture enables a performant, field-oriented, scalable system for storing and retrieving waveform-encoded semantic patterns. It combines deterministic semantics with memory-mapped speed and prepares for distributed cognitive reasoning.

Future expansions include pluggable interference models, distributed query fabric, and hybrid symbolic-wavefront orchestration.
