# 🧱 ResonanceDB: Implementation and Scaling

### *Architectural Design, Storage Format, and Horizontal Expansion*

---

## ⚙️ 1. Overview

ResonanceDB is a waveform-based cognitive storage system designed to hold and retrieve semantic patterns using **constructive interference**. This document details the **low-level architecture**, **binary storage format**, **access contracts**, and **scalability mechanisms**.

Where the first whitepaper introduced the ontological and theoretical foundation, this part focuses on concrete implementation decisions and their justification.

---

## 🧩 2. Core Data Structure: WavePattern

```java
public record WavePattern(double[] amplitude, double[] phase) {
    public Complex[] toComplex() { ... }
}
```

* `amplitude[]`: real-valued intensity of meaning.
* `phase[]`: real-valued modifiers for context, modality.
* Arrays are fixed-length (configurable, e.g., 512, 1024).

> All operations on WavePattern are side-effect free and deterministic.

---

## 📦 3. Storage Format and Layout

### 3.1 File Structure

```
/resonance-db/
├── segments/
│   ├── phase-0.segment        # mmap binary file
│   ├── phase-1.segment
├── index/
│   └── manifest.idx           # segment map and offset index
├── metadata/
│   └── pattern-meta.json      # JSON: id → metadata
```

### 3.2 Segment Encoding

Each `.segment` contains a flat binary serialization of WavePatterns:

* MAGIC header (4 bytes)
* pattern count (int32)
* for each pattern:

  * amplitude\[] (double \* N)
  * phase\[] (double \* N)

Serialization is little-endian. Deserialization must verify MAGIC header.

---

## 🗺️ 4. Indexing and Manifest

The `manifest.idx` maintains:

* pattern ID (string hash)
* segment filename
* byte offset in segment
* phase range metadata

This index allows:

* O(1) or O(log n) retrieval of patterns
* filtering by phase domain (shard selection)

---

## 🚀 5. API Contract: ResonanceStore

```java
public interface ResonanceStore {
    String insert(WavePattern psi, Map<String, String> metadata);
    void delete(String id);
    void update(String id, WavePattern psi, Map<String, String> metadata);
    List<ResonanceMatch> query(WavePattern query, int topK);
    float compare(WavePattern a, WavePattern b);
}
```

### Requirements:
* All methods are thread-safe.
* `compare()` is deterministic and stateless.

---

## 🧲 6. Comparison Kernel

### 6.1 Resonance Equation

Given two ψ-patterns, the resonance energy is computed as:

$$
R(\psi_1, \psi_2) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{|\psi_1(x) + \psi_2(x)|^2}{|\psi_1(x)|^2 + |\psi_2(x)|^2} \cdot \left( \frac{2 \cdot \sqrt{E_1 \cdot E_2}}{E_1 + E_2} \right)
$$

Steps:

* Convert both patterns to complex\[]
* Pointwise sum
* Compute squared magnitude of interference
* Normalize by combined energy
* Apply amplitude balance factor

This formula yields a result in \[0.0 ... 1.0], where:

* 1.0 = full constructive interference (equal amplitude and phase)
* 0.0 = full destructive interference (opposite phase)

---

## 🌐 7. Horizontal Scaling

### 7.1 Sharding Model

Sharding is done by **phase domain**, not ID hash. Each `.segment`:

* owns a phase range (e.g., \[0.0 .. π/2]),
* can be assigned to an agent/machine.

Segment-aware query routing allows:

* distributed query agents,
* parallel scanning,
* load balancing.

### 7.2 Segment Routing Example

```
query ψ has phase avg ≈ π/3 → search in phase-1.segment
```

Routing based on phase topology enables field-localized query acceleration.

---

## 🧵 8. Concurrency and Thread Safety

* All segment writes are atomic.
* Read operations use `MappedByteBuffer` (read-only mode).
* Metadata and manifest files are updated via locks or CAS.
* Caches use `ConcurrentMap` or Caffeine.

---

## 🗰️ 9. Error Handling

| Error Condition               | Exception                     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Duplicate insert with same ID | `DuplicatePatternException`   |
| Update/delete of unknown ID   | `PatternNotFoundException`    |
| Invalid wave dimensions       | `InvalidWavePatternException` |

---

## 🔧 10. Extensibility Points

* Pluggable kernel for `compare()`
* Tag filters, time-based filters
* `ResonanceTrace`: store query dynamics
* Future: support for vector-field overlays

---

## 🧪 11. Testing Strategy

* Unit tests for insert/update/query/delete
* Interference normalization tests
* Stress test: 1M patterns, mmap performance
* Query determinism tests (repeatability)

---

## 🗂️ 12. Dependencies & Licensing

* Language: **Java 17+**
* Binary format: **custom codec** or FlatBuffers
* I/O: `MappedByteBuffer`, `FileChannel`
* Optional: RocksDB for index caching
* License: Apache 2.0 compatible only

---

## ✅ 13. Summary

This architecture enables a performant, field-oriented, scalable system for storing and retrieving waveform-encoded semantic patterns. It combines deterministic semantics with memory-mapped speed and prepares for distributed cognitive reasoning.

Future expansions include pluggable interference models, distributed query fabric, and hybrid symbolic-wavefront orchestration.
